# INR Manager App

Inspired by my requirement for lifetime anticoagulation medication, I developed a full-stack iOS application to manage and visualize my INR (International Normalized Ratio) blood test results. The first iteration of this project utilized Storyboard UI, Node.js server, and MongoDB database. The second iteration utilized SwiftUI and Firebase to implement multiple user accounts and authentication logic.

## First Iteration

To get feet wet with mobile application development, I utilized Storyboard to create basic app UI then connected this app to my MongoDB database using API endpoints from my Node.js server.

While this iteration was successful, I felt limited by Storyboard to continue expanding and building upon my app, which prompted me to attemp a full rebuild using SwiftUI.

## Second (current) Iteration

In this iteration I essentially started from stractch, using Firebase to manage authentication, user information and data. This iteration features a much more comprehensive user interface with the ability to easily add new features to the app.
